# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Arrakis is a new project currently in its initial development phase. The repository contains only basic documentation and is ready for project initialization and setup.

## Current State

This is a brand-new repository with minimal structure:
- Basic README.md with project name and description
- Git repository initialized
- No package.json, dependencies, or build configuration yet

## Development Setup

Since this project is in its initial state, development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen. Common initialization steps might include:

- Initialize package management (`npm init`, `yarn init`, `cargo init`, `go mod init`, etc.)
- Set up project structure and directories
- Configure build tools and development environment
- Add testing framework and CI/CD pipeline
- Establish coding standards and linting rules

## Next Steps

The project structure and development commands will be updated in this file once:
- Technology stack is determined
- Project architecture is established
- Build and development tooling is configured
- Testing framework is set up

## Architecture

Project architecture details will be documented here as the codebase develops and patterns emerge.
