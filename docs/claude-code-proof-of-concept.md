# Claude Code Proof of Concept Implementation

**Date**: September 27, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Operational
**Goal**: Demonstrate the Claude Code component (System B) of the dual Claude strategy

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Claude Code integration system that demonstrates the "dual Claude strategy" concept. This proof of concept shows how Claude Code (with full tool access) can be programmatically invoked to work on and improve the Arrakis codebase itself.

**Key Achievement**: Built System B - a Claude Code component that can read, write, edit files, and run commands programmatically, complementing the existing System A (basic Claude API).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Dual Claude Strategy Implementation

**System A (Existing)**: Basic Claude API Integration
- Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for simple text conversations
- Located in `lib/claude/api-client.ts` and `lib/api/routers/claude.ts`
- Request/response pattern with no tool access
- Fast and lightweight for basic interactions

**System B (New - This POC)**: Claude Code SDK Integration
- Programmatically spawns Claude Code processes with full tool access
- Located in `lib/claude-code/` directory
- Can read, write, edit files, run bash commands
- Multi-step reasoning and self-improvement capabilities

**Unified Knowledge Base**: Both systems capture conversations to the same database, creating comprehensive learning and memory system.

```

### Database Integration
- Extends existing conversation capture system
- All Claude Code sessions automatically stored in database
- Same schema as regular conversations for unified search/analysis

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Claude Code Process Manager (`claude-code-manager.ts`)

**Core Features**:
- Programmatic Claude Code process spawning
- Session lifecycle management (pending → running → completed/failed)
- Real-time output capture and monitoring
- Automatic database integration
- Timeout handling and process cleanup

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
executeTask(task: ClaudeCodeTask): Promise<string>
getSession(sessionId: string): ClaudeCodeSession | undefined
waitForCompletion(sessionId: string): Promise<ClaudeCodeResult>
stopSession(sessionId: string): boolean
```

### 2. Task Templates System (`task-templates.ts`)

**6 Predefined Templates**:
1. **Analyze Codebase** - Comprehensive code quality assessment
2. **Fix TypeScript Errors** - Identify and fix compilation errors
3. **Improve Component** - Select and enhance React components
4. **Add New Feature** - Implement meaningful new functionality
5. **Self-Improvement** - Claude Code improving its own execution system
6. **Custom Task** - User-defined prompts

**Template Structure**:
```typescript
interface TaskTemplate {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  category: 'analysis' | 'improvement' | 'feature' | 'maintenance' | 'testing'
  estimatedDuration: number
  createTask: (customPrompt?: string) => ClaudeCodeTask
}
```

### 3. API Layer (`claude-code.ts`)

**tRPC Endpoints**:
- `getTemplates` - Fetch available task templates
- `executeTask` - Start template-based execution
- `executeCustomTask` - Run user-defined tasks
- `executeDemo` - Quick capabilities demonstration
- `getSession` - Fetch session details with real-time updates
- `getAllSessions` - List all sessions with status
- `stopSession` - Terminate running sessions
- `getStatus` - System health and availability check

### 4. Web Interface

**Two-Tab Interface**:

**Task Executor Tab**:
- Template selection with categories and descriptions
- Custom task creation with title and prompt
- Quick demo for capabilities showcase
- System status monitoring
- Real-time execution feedback

**Sessions Monitor Tab**:
- Real-time session listing with auto-refresh
- Detailed session output viewing
- Session lifecycle tracking
- Stop/restart capabilities
- Direct links to captured conversations

## 🎨 User Experience
