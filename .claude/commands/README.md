## ðŸ“– How to Use Slash Commands

### In Claude Code UI
Type the command with a forward slash:
```
/deploy
/review
/focus-frontend
```

Claude Code will execute the workflow defined in the corresponding `.md` file.

### What Happens
1. The command file is loaded
2. Claude follows the workflow steps
3. Relevant agents are invoked
4. Context is switched or loaded
5. You get a guided experience for that task

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Use `/focus-*` commands** when starting work on a specific area
- **Use `/deploy`** as your pre-deployment checklist
- **Use `/review`** for thorough code reviews before merging
- Commands stack well: `/focus-frontend` then work, then `/review`, then `/deploy`

## ðŸ”§ Creating Custom Commands

1. Create a `.md` file in this directory
2. Add frontmatter with `name` and `description`
3. Define the workflow steps
4. Use markdown checklists for tracking

Example:
```markdown
---
name: my-command
description: What this command does
---
