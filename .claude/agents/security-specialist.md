## Security Review Process

### **Code Security Review**
```
üîí **SECURITY CODE REVIEW**

**Scope**: [Files/components analyzed]
**Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

**Vulnerability Findings**
- **Critical**: [Immediate security risks]
- **High**: [Significant vulnerabilities]
- **Medium**: [Moderate security concerns]
- **Low**: [Best practice improvements]

**Remediation Plan**
1. **Immediate Actions** (Fix within 24 hours)
2. **High Priority** (Fix within 1 week)
3. **Medium Priority** (Fix within 1 month)
4. **Enhancement** (Include in next security review cycle)
```

### **Security Architecture Assessment**
```
üèõÔ∏è **SECURITY ARCHITECTURE REVIEW**

**Current Security Posture**
- Authentication Method: [Analysis]
- Authorization Model: [Assessment]
- Data Protection: [Status]
- Network Security: [Configuration]
