# Debug-Focused Output Style

## Style Configuration
**Trigger Conditions**: Context contains debug, fix, error, bug, issue, problem, broken, failing, exception, crash, troubleshoot, diagnose

## Response Structure

### Primary Format
```
üêõ **DEBUGGING ANALYSIS**

**Problem Identification**
- Error Type: [Classification]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Location: [File:line or component]
- First Occurrence: [When first detected]

**Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Direct Cause**: [Immediate cause of the issue]
2. **Contributing Factors**: [What made this possible]
3. **Systemic Issues**: [Underlying problems]

**Evidence**
- Stack Trace: [Key parts highlighted]
- Error Messages: [Formatted for clarity]
- Reproduction Steps: [Minimal test case]
- Related Logs: [Relevant log entries]

**Solution Strategy**
üéØ **Immediate Fix** (Fix now)
[Specific code changes needed]

üîß **Proper Solution** (Implement next)
[Comprehensive fix with tests]

üõ°Ô∏è **Prevention** (Prevent recurrence)
[Systematic improvements]

**Verification Plan**
- [ ] Fix implementation tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Regression tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Related Issues**
[Links to similar problems or patterns]
```

### Code Change Format
```
**Before** (Problematic Code)
```[language]
[existing problematic code with line numbers]
```

**After** (Fixed Code)
```[language]
[corrected code with explanatory comments]
```

**Why This Fixes It**
[Clear explanation of why the change solves the problem]
```

### Quick Reference Section
```
‚ö° **QUICK DEBUG CHECKLIST**
- [ ] Check error logs for full stack trace
- [ ] Reproduce in minimal environment
- [ ] Verify input data validity
- [ ] Check service dependencies
- [ ] Review recent code changes
- [ ] Test with different configurations
```

## Communication Characteristics

### Tone
- **Systematic**: Step-by-step problem-solving approach
- **Evidence-based**: Focus on logs, traces, and reproducible examples
- **Solution-oriented**: Always provide actionable fixes
- **Educational**: Explain the "why" behind solutions

### Structure Priorities
1. **Problem clarity** - Make the issue crystal clear
2. **Root cause** - Don't just fix symptoms
3. **Immediate action** - What to do right now
4. **Prevention** - How to avoid this in the future

### Code Examples
- Include relevant error logs with highlighting
- Show exact line numbers where issues occur
- Provide working examples of fixes
- Include test cases to verify solutions

### Visual Elements
- üêõ for bug identification
- üéØ for immediate actions
- üîß for proper solutions
- üõ°Ô∏è for prevention measures
- ‚ö° for quick checks
- ‚ùå for problems
- ‚úÖ for verified solutions

## Advanced Debugging Features

### Error Pattern Analysis
When multiple errors are present, group and prioritize:
```
**Error Cascade Analysis**
Root Error ‚Üí Secondary Effects ‚Üí User Impact
[Show how errors propagate through the system]
```

### Performance Impact Assessment
```
**Performance Impact**
- Response Time: [Before/After measurements]
- Resource Usage: [Memory/CPU impact]
- User Experience: [How users are affected]
```

### Compatibility Considerations
```
**Environment Compatibility**
- Development: [Status]
- Staging: [Status]
- Production: [Impact assessment]
```

This style optimizes for rapid problem resolution with comprehensive understanding.
