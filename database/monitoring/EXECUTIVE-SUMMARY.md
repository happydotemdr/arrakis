## Index Strategy Assessment

### Current Index Configuration: WELL-DESIGNED

Your webhook_events table has a comprehensive index strategy:

#### Single Column Indexes (6)

1. **session_id** - Session-based queries
2. **event_type** - Event filtering
3. **status** - Status filtering
4. **received_at** - Time-range queries
5. **conversation_id** - Outcome tracking
6. **request_id** (UNIQUE) - Idempotency

#### Composite Indexes (3)

1. **event_type + status** - Combined filtering
2. **session_id + received_at** - Session history
3. **status + received_at** - Status timeline

### Index Assessment: OPTIMAL FOR EXPECTED WORKLOAD

**Strengths**:

- Covers all major query patterns
- Good balance between read and write performance
- Composite indexes match expected WHERE clause combinations
- Unique index on request_id prevents duplicates

**Potential Optimizations** (after measuring actual usage):

1. **Partial Indexes** (if certain statuses are rare):

```sql
-- If PENDING events are < 10% of data
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_webhook_events_pending_received
ON webhook_events (received_at)
WHERE status = 'PENDING';

-- If ERROR events need fast querying
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_webhook_events_errors
ON webhook_events (received_at, event_type, error_code)
WHERE status IN ('FAILED', 'ERROR');
```

2. **Performance Monitoring Index** (for diagnostic queries):

```sql
-- Helps identify slow events quickly
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_webhook_events_processing_time
ON webhook_events (processing_time DESC)
WHERE processing_time > 1000;
```

3. **Retry Queue Index**:

```sql
-- Optimizes retry processing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_webhook_events_retry_queue
ON webhook_events (retry_after)
WHERE status = 'PENDING_RETRY' AND retry_after IS NOT NULL;
```

### Recommendation: MONITOR FIRST, OPTIMIZE LATER

Do NOT add these indexes immediately. Instead:

1. Run production for 24-48 hours
2. Analyze actual query patterns with `05-index-analysis.sql`
3. Identify which indexes are heavily used vs. unused
4. Add new indexes based on real usage data
5. Drop any unused indexes after 1 week
