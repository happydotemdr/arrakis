# Frontend Focus Mode

Switch context to frontend development with React, Next.js, and UI components.

## Context Loading

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- [ ] Read `src/app/` directory structure (Next.js App Router)
- [ ] Identify key pages and routes
- [ ] Review component organization in `src/components/`
- [ ] Check UI library configuration (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS)

### 2. Component Patterns
- [ ] Review existing component patterns
- [ ] Check for reusable components
- [ ] Identify layout and page components
- [ ] Note state management approach (React hooks, context, etc.)

### 3. Styling Context
- [ ] Load Tailwind configuration from `tailwind.config.ts`
- [ ] Review CSS/styling patterns
- [ ] Check component library usage (shadcn/ui)
- [ ] Note any custom styles or themes

### 4. API Integration
- [ ] Review API client configuration (tRPC, REST, etc.)
- [ ] Check data fetching patterns
- [ ] Identify API route handlers in `src/app/api/`
- [ ] Note authentication/authorization patterns

### 5. Frontend Dependencies
- [ ] Review `package.json` for frontend libraries
- [ ] Check React version and features in use
- [ ] Note Next.js version and configuration
- [ ] Identify form libraries, validation, etc.
